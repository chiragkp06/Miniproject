# Cloud-Based Pneumonia Detection

## Overview
This project is a cloud-based application designed to help **radiologists** detect **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using machine learning and cloud services. The application leverages AWS services like **Rekognition**, **S3**, and **RDS** to process and store the images and results. 

## Project Objective
- To build a web-based system where users (radiologists) can upload chest X-ray images and receive pneumonia detection results.
- The system will indicate if pneumonia is detected and provide a confidence score based on the analysis.
- The results will be stored in an **RDS database** and displayed on a web interface, with downloadable reports for the radiologists.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: (Include details of the technologies used, e.g., HTML/CSS,JS etc.)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AWS Services**: 
  - **AWS Rekognition** for image analysis
  - **AWS S3** for storing images
  - **AWS RDS** for storing results and other relevant data
- **Other**: 
  - Python libraries (Flask, boto3, etc.)
  - Environment Variables: .env for sensitive information

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. You need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. You will need an **AWS account** for using services like Rekognition, S3, and RDS.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
